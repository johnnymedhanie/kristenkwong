# Hey, I'm Kristen! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an incoming software engineer at Apple on the Siri Client team. I recently graduated from the University of British Columbia, where I studied Computer Science. I like learning and building stuff related to operating systems and compilers!

## Previously...

- I interned at Apple twice before my full-time role.
- I co-founded [UBC Local Hack Day](https://lhd.nwplus.io), which has since become a part of [nwPlus](https://www.nwplus.io).
- I have been a Teaching Assistant for CPSC 110: Computation, Programs, and Programming and 304: Introduction to Relational Databases at UBC.

## In my free time

- I make websites and do web design for fun.
- I paint and draw sometimes.
- I enjoy playing video games. Recently, I've been playing a lot of League of Legends, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and Teamfight Tactics.
